## Recursion 
when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.
In direct recursion, function calls itself while in indirect recursion the function fun1 calls another function fun2 which calls the fun1 function.

A solve a problem using recursion we must know solution to a smaller problem and bigger problems are solved using this small problem. 
These small problems are the base cases which can be solved on their own.   

`returnType functionName(parameters){
    base_case {
        operations to be performed on base case
    }

    <!-- perform some operation -->
    call for smaller problem 
    functionName(smaller Parameter)

}`
